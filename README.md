# Delinquent Analysis Case Study

## Problem Statement

### Context
DRS bank is facing challenging times. Their NPAs (Non-Performing Assets) have been on the rise recently, and a large part of these are due to the loans given to individual customers (borrowers). The Chief Risk Officer of the bank has decided to implement a scientifically robust framework for loan approvals to individual customers to minimize the risk of loans converting into NPAs and has initiated a project for the data science team at the bank. You, as a senior member of the team, are assigned this project.

### Objective
To identify the criteria for approving loans for individual customers to minimize the likelihood of loan delinquency and identify the factors that drive loan delinquency behavior.
